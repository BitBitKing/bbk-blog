      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we will talk about what is MEV, which stands for Maximal Extractable Value, also known as maximizing profits on the Ethereum blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the popularity of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has become one of the most popular blockchains. MEV refers to the maximum value obtained through transactions on the Ethereum network. This value comes from operations such as flash loans, arbitrage, and price manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Ethereum transactions, miners can obtain MEV profits by reordering and packaging transactions. For example, they can buy relevant tokens before the transaction and sell them after the transaction, profiting from the price difference.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
